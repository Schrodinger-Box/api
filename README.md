# Schrodinger's Box API Scheme Repository

This repository serves the purpose of syncing API schemes between different platforms.

Since SwaggerHub do the syncing job ONE-WAY, you should ALWAYS edit the API schema in SwaggerHub editor, NOT anywhere else including the Postman editor.

# Versions

Current version is 1.0.0 and is still work in progress. Please check [branch 1.0](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Box/api/tree/1.0) for the API specification file.
